# 1. Co-teaching
The Co-teaching IMDb model was reproduced independently using TensorFlow 2.x and Python 3.x, differing from the original environment described in the source paper, as well as applying it to a different task. While the original paper focused on noise processing in image data, I adapted this method to handle noise in text data. Using this approach improved the accuracy from 69% to 81%.
